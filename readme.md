# MatchTheNet

This is a game about 3-dimensional polytopes for a single player.
You will meet the five Platonic Solids and their best friends.

In each round of the game you will see some polytopes on the top half of the window.
You can rotate them to look at them from all sides.

In the bottom half you will see the same number of planar nets.
These are unfoldings of polytopes into the plane.
The goal is to match the nets to the polytopes.
You can switch any pair of nets by moving one over the other.
